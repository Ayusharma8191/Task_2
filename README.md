Sentiment Analysis of Reviews 📊🧠
This project involves training a sentiment analysis model using a provided dataset with text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral). The task covers text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of performance metrics.

Requirements 📥
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

1. pandas 📂
2. nltk 📝
3. scikit-learn ⚙️
4. tensorflow (Optional for deep learning models) 🧠
   
You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn tensorflow
```
Setup ⚙️
Download necessary NLTK resources: The project requires some NLTK resources, such as the stopwords list and punkt tokenizer. Run the following code to download them:
```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```
Dataset 📄: The dataset (sentiment_analysis.csv) should have the following columns:

text: Contains the textual reviews.
sentiment: Contains the sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
Replace the path in the code with the correct path to your dataset.
```bash
df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/sentiment_analysis.csv')
```
Code Overview 🔍
Step 1: Text Preprocessing 🧹
Preprocess the text data by:

Tokenizing the text (converting to lowercase and splitting by spaces).
Removing stopwords and punctuation.
Vectorizing the text using TfidfVectorizer.
```bash
def preprocess_text(text):
    tokens = text.lower().split()
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words and word not in string.punctuation]
    return " ".join(tokens)

reviews_cleaned = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)
```
Step 2: Model Training 🏋️‍♀️
Using Scikit-learn's Multinomial Naive Bayes model as an example, the steps are as follows:

Vectorize the text data using TfidfVectorizer to convert text into numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
Train the model using the training set.
```bash
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(reviews_cleaned)
y = df['sentiment']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
Alternatively, if using TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models, adjust the model training code accordingly.

Step 3: Model Evaluation 📊
Evaluate the model on the test set by calculating the following metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: Proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.
Recall: Proportion of actual positives that were correctly predicted.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

```bash
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
```
Step 4: Model Optimization 🔧
To optimize the model for better performance, consider the following techniques:

Hyperparameter tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the best parameters for your model.
Feature Engineering: Experiment with different feature extraction techniques, such as using Word2Vec or BERT embeddings for more advanced vectorization.
Model Selection: Try other models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for more complex datasets.
Cross-validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and reduce overfitting.
Running the Code ▶️
To run the code, ensure that you've set up the environment with the necessary libraries and dataset. Then, execute the script to see the preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation metrics.
